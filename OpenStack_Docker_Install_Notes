When testing Nova Docker driver

sudo cp /opt/stack/nova-docker/etc/nova/rootwrap.d/docker.filters /etc/nova/rootwrap.d

docker pull cirros
sudo glance image-create --name cirros --visibility public --container-format docker --disk-format raw

sudo nova boot --image cirros --flavor ml.tiny dl
sudo nova list
sudo nova show d1

Current issue.
Source environment variables is successful (can echo) but not recognized.
Instead, found that inserting variables in hte nova boot command seems to be taking but is not being accepted

Will need to post to mail list
